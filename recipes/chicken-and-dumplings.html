                    <h3>Instructions</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large heavy bottomed pot (like a dutch oven), melt butter over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook for 5 minutes, until vegetables being to wilt.
                             Add garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
                        <li>Add flour and stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Add evaporated milk and chicken stock and quickly stir to combine.</li>
                        <li>Bring to a boil and add chicken, thyme, black pepper and salt.
                             Let soup simmer, uncovered, while you make dumplings.</li>
                        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, pepper, salt and thyme.
                             Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour the milk and butter into the center of it. </li>
                        <li>Using a wooden spoon (or rubber spatula), stir together until dough ball forms.
                             If your dough seems too dry, you can add an extra tablespoon of milk.</li>
                        <li>Using a large** sized cookie scoop, scoop dough and drop directly into the simmering soup.
                             Place them around the pot, not all in the same place.</li>
                        <li>Once all dumplings have been added, gently press them down
                             so the soup runs over just the tops of them. </li>
                        <li>Place the lid on your pot and lower the heat a little to a low simmer 
                            (you donâ€™t want the bottom of the soup to burn but also want the soup to still be simmering to cook the dumplings).</li>
                        <li>Cook for 15 minutes, gently stir the soup/dumplings
                             and then cut one dumpling in half to make sure they are cooked through.</li>
                        <li>If the dumplings are cooked through, serve hot! If not,
                             cook an additional 2-3 minutes and check again.</li>                   
                    </ol>
